yum install python3 python3-pip wget unzip git -y
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install PyMySQL
python3 -m pip install mysql-connector-python
python3 -m pip install psycopg2==2.7.5 --ignore-installed

#### Craeting anlother database and user 

# Databases.
mysql_databases:
   - name: Homestead
     collation: utf8_general_ci
     encoding: utf8
     replicate: 1

# Users.
mysql_users: 
  - name: 'Homestead'
    host: 172.31.21.41 (jenkins-ansible server)
    password: secret
    priv: '*.*:ALL,GRANT'


 then 
we launch our windows terminal and connevct to the database to be sure of the database we created to be there 

so only my database was creating and decided to login the instance and create a user according to the project 
Create database homestead;
CREATE USER 'homestead'@'jenkins-server-ip' IDENTIFIED BY 'sePret^i';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'homestead'@'jenkins-servre -ip';

To confirm 
sudo mysql 
show databases;
select user, host from mysql.user;
